# 1730-Project-1
**Group Members**
- Joeseph Fritz
- Mason Protsman
- Andrew Phipps

**Contributions**
  Each method and their solutions were discussed by the entire group before being completed. Each member of the group hashed out ideas and shared code on every method. Once we felt like we knew what we needed to do for each method the person chosen to submit the project (Andrew Phipps) typed out the final implementation, asking for suggestions and referring to the other group members' code when needed.

**Questions**
1. 3x3
2. A 2-D int array.
3. greet()
4. init(), draw(), move(), and won() 

**Instructions**
- Compiling: To compile type "make" or "gcc -o fifteen fifteen.c"

- Running: To run the code type: "make run" or "./fifteen d" (d standing for the desired dimension) after compiling. If using the test cases type out "./fifteen 3 < 3x3.txt" or "./fifteen 4 < 4x4.txt"
